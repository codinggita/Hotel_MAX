        <p>They were extremely accommodating and allowed us to check in early at like 10am. We got to hotel super early and I didn’t wanna wait. So this was a big plus. The sevice was exceptional as well. Would definitely send a friend there.

        <p>Great stay in this hotel
           Located 30 minutes outside the city, this property is a luxurious modern stay. The infinity pool on the terrace is the perfect for a relaxing time and stunning view. The staff is very attentive. The breakfast and dinner buffet had a good variety but given the pricing of the stay, it could have been more lavish.
           Overall would recommend for a weekend away from the city</p>
